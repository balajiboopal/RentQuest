The building derives its name from The Quinault, the Native American people who once roamed Western Washington and whose descendants now inhabit a reservation near Aberdeen. Whitestone columns shaped like twin turrets bracket the entryway. Lantern-like lights are anchored into the white stone, and they cast an amber glow at night. The top of the building's exterior is crenelated in parts, like the battlements of a castle. Inside, Aztec-style archways lead toward apartment units with hardwood floors, high ceilings, and metal radiators. There are 46 units in total, 44 are studios and there are 2 one bedroom/1 bath units. The building is located on Capitol Hill.
